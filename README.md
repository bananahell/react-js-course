# react-js-course

Some projects to learn ReactJS.  
Got it all from [Smoljames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82PXenL4MGg)!!  
All projects are in this repo. Built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/). Just navigate to the project you want to run and ```npm install``` then ```npm run dev```!  

## Todo list

A simple todo list to learn the basics of React. In it, I learned React's project structure and the React'ive properties of its components by using ```useState()``` and ```useEffect()```.  

## APOD

Another simple project to learn how to consume APIs. [Nasa's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://api.nasa.gov/) was used to show the content available from its API. The project shows Nasa's "APOD" and describes it as its API does.
